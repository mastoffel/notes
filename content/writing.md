I've tried writing a blog for many years now. Often, just to find myself using a new static site generator (like [quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) now), and re-designing the theme, rather than actually writing things. 

The reason I'd like to write is to be able to think and learn better. Often, we think that we understand something, but the we actually don't. There's a superficial feeling of reward when we watch [3b1b](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown)videos, and that can be a first step to understanding, but it's not going to get you all the way. 

One way of learning things is to apply them at work or in a project that's important. The problem here is that such things have goals or deadlines, and a deeper exploration beyond what's needed is often difficult to do.

Also, many topics don't have a direct application. If I'd like to get a grip on whether universal basic income is a good idea, whether collapsing insect populations will massively impact the economy, whether its possible to align AI or how [[ultra-processed foods]] change the gut microbiome, writing about them feels like a good way to a better understand.

My plan now is to do this: First, find a topic that I'm really, genuinely interested in. Second, do some research. Third, write. But before I start writing properly, I thought it would be good to sharpen the saw.

Therefore, I did some research on writing a blog. Here's the main insights I gained:
