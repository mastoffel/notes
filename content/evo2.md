questions: 
- how does the training work?
- how does it learn function from only DNA training?
- how does it deal with different variation etc. for different genus/ different sample size per organism

previously: evo trained on prokaryotes only

> evo 2, a biological foundation model that is trained on a representative snapshot of genomes spanning all observed evolution.

> Evo 2 learns how mutations affect protein, RNA, and organismal fitness, while now generalizing beyond prokaryotes to include humans, plants, yeast, and other eukaryotes

> Evo 2 is the first language model capable of scoring the impact of all variant types on pathogenicity and splicing

> we demonstrate controllable generation by using models of epigenomic state to design novel DNA sequences for which we can specify the location and length of chromatin-accessible regions, allowing us to write simple Morse code messages into our epigenomic designs

trained on: 9.3 trillion base pairs DNA
data spanning all domains of life
single-nucleotide resolution
learns function from DNA sequence alone???
